# mtail - extract whitebox monitoring data from application logs for collection into a timeseries database

`heplify-logprom` is a `mtail` fork which is a tool for extracting metrics
from application logs to be exported into a timeseries database
or timeseries calculator for alerting and dashboarding.

`heplify-logprom` provides one additional builtin function 
```
sendhep(msg, cid)
```
which takes one extracted message together with one extracted correlation ID
and sends them protobuf encoded to `heplify-server`. With this addition you 
can ship logs to `heplify-server` and expose metrics for prometheus.

It aims to fill a niche between applications that do not export their own
internal state, and existing monitoring systems, without patching those
applications or rewriting the same framework for custom extraction glue code.

The extraction is controlled by [mtail programs](docs/Programming-Guide.md)
which define patterns and actions:

    # simple line counter
    counter line_count
    /$/ {
      line_count++
    }

Metrics are exported for scraping by a collector as JSON or Prometheus format
over HTTP, or can be periodically sent to a collectd, StatsD, or Graphite
collector socket.

Read the [programming guide](docs/Programming-Guide.md) if you want to learn how
to write mtail programs.

## Installation

There are various ways of installing **mtail**.

### Precompiled binaries

Precompiled binaries for released versions are available in the
[Releases page](https://github.com/google/mtail/releases) on Github. Using the
latest production release binary is the recommended way of installing **mtail**.

Windows, OSX and Linux binaries are available.

### Building from source

To build `mtail` from the source code yourself you need to have a working Go
environment with version 1.9 or greater installed, also some additional tools
like `goyacc`.  You can't `go get` the software and have it build straight away.
Sorry.

See the [Build instructions](docs/Building.md) for more details.

A `Dockerfile` is included in this repository for local development as an
alternative to installing Go in your environment, and takes care of all the
build dependency installation, if you don't care for that.


## Deployment

`mtail` works best when it paired with a timeseries-based calculator and
alerting tool, like [Prometheus](http://prometheus.io).

[It deals with the instrumentation so the engineers don't have
to!](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/quotes/qt0386890)  It has the
extraction skills!  It is good at dealing with log files!!
